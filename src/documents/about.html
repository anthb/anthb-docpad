<h1>G'day, welcome to my website - Anthony Bordonaro</h1>

<p>There's a little bit about me over in the side panel. I'm mainly using this website to write down things I find interesting on the web and to experiment, so expect for some features to either be broken or only supporting the latest browsers (please don't come here using IE8). If you want to know more, get in contact with me through <a href="http://twitter.com/bordy_7">Twitter</a>.</p>
