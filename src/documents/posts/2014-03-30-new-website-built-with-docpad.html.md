I must confess as a professional web developer, this website has been empty for close to two years... oops. Here we are a quarter of the way through 2014, and I'm back!

Some time ago I was an avid WordPress fan, I used it at work and personally to power this website. I loved WordPess for its ease of use, big community and lots of really great plugins. Mid 2011 I made the switch from general web developer where I was using PHP a lot in day to day work, to specialise in front-end development. It was around this time that I spent less and less time using WordPress and started noticing that my WordPress site kept getting hacked. The process was basically:

1.	Restore
2.	Wait a few weeks
3.	Notice I've been hacked again
4.  See point 1

One of the main reasons that WordPress was so popular, its plugin system, was also a huge reason it was a big target for hackers. After quite a few restorations I got annoyed and took my site offline permantently. Fast forward to 2014 when I recently began redeveloping my website when I started to think, *do I need to use WordPress?* Well... not really, no. When it comes down to it, I am a web developer who builds things for the web, in my mind and at a basic level a CMS gives us two main things:

1.	The ability to order and catalogue a lot of content and pages so its easily maintained
2.	The ability for those who aren't developers to publish a website

I had point two covered, and had come across [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a static site generators which would handle point one. If you haven't come across Jekyll before, it is a Ruby based static site generator that became very popular when [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) adopted it. I had briefly played around with Jekyll in mid 2013 and was annoyed at how much work it involved upgrading my OSX and Ruby in order to get Jekyll to actually build. I now have a new MacBook Pro with Mavericks installed, which yet again has a heap of issues in getting Jekyll to work. It was at this point that I started searching around for Node based solutions, I mean I am a front-end dev who uses JavaScript everyday, why do I need to use a ruby based tool I don't understand. I stumbled across [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) and instantly felt like it was the right tool to use.

A real strength of DocPad is the fact that it's document format can be abstracted to use whatever format you want, you just need a [plugin](http://docpad.org/docs/plugins) to do that. I won't go into detail on how DocPad works as there are better resources out there, I would start on the [DocPad Homepage](http://docpad.org/) and go from there. There are quite a few skeleton options to choose from to get you started, I didn't want to use an existing framework so chose not to. A guy called [Erv Walter](http://www.ewal.net/) is doing pretty much exactly what I was hoping to acheive to I cloned his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ervwalter/ewalnet-docpad) and customised it for me, it's a really good resource and a good starting point for a simple blog format with a lot [neat additions](http://www.ewal.net/2013/10/13/draft-posts-with-docpad/).

So that was a brief account of the decisions I made in recreating my website, it's kind of a work in progress so I will be updating as I go.

Cheers,
Ant.
